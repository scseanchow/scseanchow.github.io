                    Intro
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Zenreach is a late stage startup which modernizes marketing for the offline world. With offices located in San Francisco, Arizona and Kitchener, I worked as a software
                    developer at the Kitchener office. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Goals
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At the job, I had many goals which included:
                    - Gain knowledge of the react/redux framework and sharpen up my JS skills
                    - Learn the python framework Django
                    - Apply test driven development and perform code reviews
                    
                    Throughout my term I met all of these goals, and kept a constant communication with my manager on areas to improve in as a developer.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Job Description
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My main duties were full-stack development, experimenting and learning technologies such as React/Reudx, Django, Babel and Webpack to name a few. 
                    I worked on the core product team, where I worked on an agile product team working on new features for the web application. During my term, we were building
                    a new customer experience UI, creating new user experiences and adding much desired features from our users. My technical responsibilities inlcuded designing HTTP API endpoints,
                    create Django models and architect the front-end and it's data stores.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion I had a great time working at Zenerach and my manager and team were great. Working in an innovative VC funded company exposed me to the
                    fast paced and interesting start up market, while also teaching me valuable skills in new tech which I haven't worked with before. Overall it was a great experience
                    and i'd highly recommend the workplace.
