                    Intro
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tulip is a software service company which aims at empowering the sales associate in a retail setting. Think of it as bridging
                    the gap between ecommerce and brick and mortar stores. The app is designed for iOS mobile tablets, and
                    displays a store catalogue with options to purchase alongside many other features. The culture at Tulip
                    is great, with an emphasis on inclusion and was a great working environment as a co-op student. There
                    are two offices, one in Kitchener and one in Toronto, I worked at the Kitchener location.

                <h3>
                    Goals
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At the job, I had many goals which included: - Gain knowledge of a ticketing system and it's workflow - Write cleaner code
                    with emphasis on reliability and readability - Learn new technologies, frameworks and languages These
                    were goals as I entered the job, and they all remained, but new ones emerged as I took upon more responsibilities
                    and learned more about the job.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Job Description
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My main duties were back-end development, with focus on PHP with a little bit of Python. I focused on integrations work,
                    which is the transformation of a clients data into our own system's data to be used on the app. Skills
                    needed for the job include attentiveness to detail and efficiency. Also working with a team, collaboration
                    is a huge skill which is always required in almost any environment. A unique and interesting aspect of
                    my job was working with large amounts of data and creating importers with a focus on algorithm efficency.
                    Some transferrable skills included PHP and Python which I happened to learn in a few courses, although
                    the rest I learned on the job.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion I had a great time working at Tulip and the employees there made the experience a blast. I learned a lot of
                    skills which are definitely transferrable to other jobs and my future career in computer science. Being
                    able to work at such a forward thinking company is truly inspiring that is creating a disruptive product
                    in today's markets.
