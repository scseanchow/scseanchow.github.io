                    Intro
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my work term report created for Freshbooks! Here you'll learn about my duties at Freshbooks as a Software Developer
                    as well as learn more about the product and the work I completed this term. Freshbooks is a software
                    as a service company which helps empower small business owners who don't know accounting, manage their
                    expenses, request invoices and much more. First and foremost, the culture and talent at Freshbooks is
                    among the best, I had a great time working there and I truly felt like a full-time employee. The office
                    itself was also amazing, a dog friendly office never failed to put a smile on my face and I think I gained
                    an equal amount of skill at pingpong as I did coding!
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Goals
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At the job, I had many goals which included: - Gain knowledge of a flask and python back-end development - Learn a front-end
                    javascript framework, Ember in this case - Develop my skills in machine learning and data science These
                    were goals as I entered the job, and many I was able to fulfill, as well as many new ones I created a
                    long the way.


                </p>
                <h3>
                    Job Description
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At Freshbooks, I worked on team Compass and eventually team Encompass , which has a mandate to help guide users through all
                    stages of the web app and then work on customer acquisition. Lots of my work was focused in either Flask
                    (Python) and EmberJS (Javascript) work. I worked on features using customer data on how to better the
                    product, which included tasks such as: increasing mobile app engagement, SMS integration and iOS push
                    notifications. My everyday consisted of getting into office, attending meetings and standup then getting
                    to code. For every task I did, tests were a large portion of the development, so I was able to learn
                    about various testing suites such as Capybara and the Cucumber tool. As well, I received valuable feedback
                    on all my pull requests from experienced software developers at the company which helped accelerate my
                    learning and progression as a softwarew developer.

                <h3>
                    Conclusions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion I had a great time working at Freshbooks and the employees and my team especially made it a great experience.
                    The company truly valued each employee and motivated development and learning, and was a great four months
                    towards my career growth.
